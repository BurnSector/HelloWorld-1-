# Hello! A bit about me
I am a student, teacher, and learner of many disciplines. I like to inspire others and have many little projects that have sat in the back of my to-do list for far too long. I'm checking them off one by one, and eventually I will have several tools created by me assisting in the silly day-to-day tasks I hope to use them in.

# HelloWorld-1-
This is probably the 50th hello world I wrote, but... It's to get more used to the github system for professional use.

# Favourite Books
So I have many books that I really enjoyed. Some of them include Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz, As a Man Thinketh by James Allen, an assortment of personal development books by others such as Sanjay Gupta MD and Tim Ferris and Zig Ziggler, and the Artemis Fowl series by Eoin Colfer. Highly underrated series and the movie doesn't do the ingenuity justice.
