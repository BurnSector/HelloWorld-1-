# Hello! A bit about me
I am a student, teacher, and learner of many disciplines. I like to inspire others and have many little projects that have sat in the back of my to-do list for far too long. I'm checking them off one by one, and eventually I will have several tools created by me assisting in the silly day-to-day tasks I hope to use them in.

# HelloWorld-1-
This is probably the 50th hello world I wrote, but... It's to get more used to the github system for professional use.
